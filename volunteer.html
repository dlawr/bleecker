        <p>Active volunteers are vital to the success of the Bleecker Historical Society. To become a BHS volunteer, please send an email to <a title="Email" href="mailto: bleeckerhistoricalsociety@gmail.com" target="_self">bleeckerhistoricalsociety@gmail.com</a> stating your skills, hours available to volunteer per week, and the number of weeks you would be willing to volunteer. We currently welcome volunteers in a variety of regular and occasional positions:<br /><br /><strong>Collections Management</strong><br /><br />Collections volunteers staff our Archive at the Bleecker Town Hall during regular weekly hours, assist patrons with research, accession items to the collections, and undertake minor conservation of artifacts. No special skills are required, and an orientation session will be provided to volunteers, introducing them to the collections, our procedures, and conservation methods. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Press and Publicity</strong><br /><br />Volunteers are needed to assist with the creation of print publicity such as posters, flyers, and brochures, as well as to update our website and issue press releases to local newspapers and radio stations. If you have access to a computer and an internet connection, much of this work can be done at home. Some artistic ability is helpful, but if you would like to learn these skills, the Society can provide training.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Research and Writing</strong><br /><br />Research volunteers assist the Society with the vital work of investigating Bleecker history and communicating those findings to the general public. Research may take place online, at our own Archive, or at other local institutions such as the Fulton County deed office or area libraries. While previous research and writing experience is helpful, the Society can provide training if you would like to learn.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Events and Hospitality</strong><br /><br />Volunteers are needed for setup and cleanup at our occasional special events and fundraisers, such as our Ice Cream Social, Christmas Open House, and Photo Festival. Some physical labor is required, such as setting up chairs, tables and tents. Most of our special events offer (or sell) light refreshments including baked goods, sandwiches and beverages, and the Society gratefully welcomes such donations. <br /><br /><br /></p>
