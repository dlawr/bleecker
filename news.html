        <div class="typelist-note-label">ICE CREAM SOCIAL</div>
        <div class="typelist-note">The annual Ice Cream Social held on August 6th at the Old School Museum was a success with beautiful weather and wonderful music by the Durey Creek Band.  Thank you to all who made it a success by selling tickets, setting up outdoor canopy and table and chairs, obtaining and serving the ice cream, those baking delicious items for our bake sale, and of course all of you attended. 
          A plaque in recognition of efforts of Nancy Buyce in preserving the District 3 Bleecker school house was dedicated during the afternoon. 
          A special thank you to the Brink family who open the school house for this event and to Stewarts Ice Cream Shop in Meco for donating the ice cream.
